## Summary

Here we attempt to apply two machine learning models `LogisticRegression` and `RandomForest` on a credit card default data set to predict whether the customer will default on the credit card payment for the next month in order to lower the risk for banks to issue credit card to more reliable clients. The result indicates that `LogisticRegression` with optimized hyperparameter `class_weight='balanced'` and `C=382` is the best performing model. We get f1 score of 0.5 for prediction on test data. It is a fair score but there is room for improvement. We suggest future research to apply feature engineering and to obtain more data for a better predication accuracy.

## Introduction

In recent years, credit card becomes more and more popular in Taiwan. Because card-issuing banks are all trying to increase market share, there exists more unqualified applicants who are not able to pay their credit card on time. This behavior is very harmful to both banks and cardholders.[@yeh2009comparisons] It is always better to prevent than to solve a problem. By detecting patterns of people who tend to default their credit card payment, banks are able to minimize the risk of issuing credit card to people who may not be able to pay on time.

Here we would like to use a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a person is going to default on his/her credit card payment. We plan to try both `Logistic Regression` and `Random Forest` on the training data with default parameter and optimized hyperparameters. We will pick the best performing model with optimized hyperparameters to predict on the test data. Thus, if the machine learning algorithm can make accurate prediction, banks are able to find reliable applicants and minimize their loss on default payment. 

## Methods

### Data

The dataset we are using in the project is originally from Department of Information Management in Chun Hua University, Taiwan and Department of Civil Engineering in Tamkang University, Taiwan. It was sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#). Specifically, [This file](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00350/default%20of%20credit%20card%20clients.xls) is what we used to build the model. This dataset has information on default payments of credit card in Taiwan from April to September 2005. There are 30,000 observations of distinct credit card clients in this data set with each row representing a unique client. There are 25 variables in total(24 features and 1 target). Within the 24 features, 23 of them are useful features for the prediction (we will drop `ID` column since it is irrelevant to the prediction). Our target is `default.payment.next.month` column. There are 2 classes in the column, with `class 0` representing a client paying their next bill and `class 1` representing a clent defaulting on their next bill payment. We notice there exists class imbalance in the target column. 77.9% of the examples belong to `class 1` and only 22.1% of examples belong to `class 0`. Because we are interested to find customers who are likely to default on their payment, predicting `class 1` correctly is more imortant to us rather than getting a good accuracy score. With a high accuracy score, we may miss potentially high amounts of false positives or negatives which would include customers who we predict will not default when they actually will. For this reason, we care more about the recall score. At the same time, precision score is also very important because if we predict customers to the wrong class, it my hurt customer loyalty. Therefore, considering the importance of both recall and precision, we have chosen f1 score as our metrics for assessment. Below is a graph indicating the class imbalance in our target.

```

### Analysis

Based on the description of the dataset, we divided features into 2 types: numerical features and categorical features. In terms of numerical features, for each individual we have the prior 6 months of monthly bill amounts(measured in Taiwanese currency) as well as the history of payment. The features labelled as `PAY_0`, `PAY_2`...`PAY_6` represents the delay in repayment in months where a larger value indicates slower repayment. Furthermore, we also have credit card limit (`LIMIT_BAL`) and `AGE` as our numerical features. We examined the correlation between all the numerical features and the target, based on the plot we found that credit limit is likely to be negative correlated to the target and age is slightly positively correlated to the target. Also, `BILL_AMT` features are negative correlated to our target, and the older the `BILL_AMT`(compare to the due date), the less correlated it is to the target. 
 
```{r fig.cap = 'Figure 2: Correlation between numeric features and target', out.width = '50%'}
include_graphics('../results/figures/correlation_plot.png')
```

In terms of categorical features, we have `SEX`, `EDUCATION` and `MARRIAGE`. Based on the plot and data description, we have 6 categories for `EDUCATION` with 1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others and 5,6=unknown. The plot suggests that people with lower levels of education may have a higher proportion of default payments as compared to those with higher levels of education. However, we note that we do have some categories that warrant further inspection of the data to remove ambiguous categories such as 'Other' and "Unknown'. Without further information, we believe this would have a minor effect on our prediction accuracy but note this as a feature for further review.

```

A more comprehensive review and analysis of the data is available in our EDA report including information about data transformation steps that were taken. The EDA report can be found [Here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522_group_12/blob/main/src/project_eda.md)


Both a linear classification model `LogisticRegression` and an ensemble decision tree classification model. We compared their performance with default parameters first then apply hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter optimization was completed using a randomized search method (scikit-learn's `RandomSearchCV`) with 5 iterations and 5-fold cross validation. The hyperparameters `class_weight` and `C` were optimized for `Logistic Regression` and n_estimators and max_depth for `Random Forest`. The R[@R] and Python[@Python] programming languages and the following R and Python packages were used to perform the analysis: docopt[@docopt], feather[@featherr], knitr[@knitr], tidyverse[@tidyverse]and Pandas[@reback2020pandas].

## Results & Discussion

To look at which model is better for prediction, we first compare the two models with default hyperparameters. We used `DummyRegression` with `strategy='prior'` as our baseline. Compare to the baseline, both `RandomForest` and `LogisticRegression` has better score on f1(0.47 and 0.51 respectively). However, we also noticed that `RandomForest` has a very high f1 on the training set, but the score is low on the validation set, and there exists a huge gap between the two scores, which means we have an overfitting problem. 

```{r compare results, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
result_compare <- read_csv('../results/prediction/prediction_prelim_results.csv')
knitr::kable(result_compare, caption = 'Table 1.Comparison between accuracy and f1 with default hyperparameters on training set ')
```

Since the validation scores were comparable, we then tune hyperparameters for both models and compare the results. As indicated in the results table below, our best f1 score on cross-validation is 0.51. The best performing model is `Logistic Regression` with `class_weight='balanced'` and `C=382`.

```{r f1 results, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
result_f1 <- read_csv('../results/prediction/prediction_hp_results.csv')
knitr::kable(result_f1, caption='Table 2. F1 score with optimized hyperpamaters for each model')
```

With the best performing model, we tried to predict on our test data and the f1 score on the test set is 0.5. Based on the result above, we find that although `LogisticRegression` is the better model to use between the two, the f1 score is only around 0.5 which suggests that there is still a lot of errors in prediction.

```{r fig.cap = 'Figure 4: Confusion matrix for LogistricRegression', out.width = '50%'}
include_graphics('../results/figures/confusionmtx.png')
```
If we look at the confusion matrix from the test set, we can see that of 7,500 examples, the model predicted slightly less than 75% of these correctly. However, we also note that it falsely predicted that more than 1,200 customers (15%) would pay their next bill when in fact they would not. This is important as if this model were to be used by a bank, it would not flag these customers for intervention. The more than 600 customers that were predicted to default when they actually would not is a less risky error. A 15% 'miss' rate is a substantial error that may not make this model acceptable for deployment as a prediction tool.

With the above in mind, we propose some future improvements to the model. One improvement is to perform feature engineering. We only have 23 features for the model to learn, which is very limited for problem like this. Future research may consider to create new features that would help the model to better learn the pattern, or if possible, to gather from customers such as ccupation, known net asset value, bank account value, number of credit cards, etc.
A second improvement is to look at obtaining more data. The data currently is limited to a very small population (banks in Taiwan) over a short period of time (6 months in 2005). By expanding this over more countries and over additional years may allow for the inclusion features that capture external events such as recessions and other economic events that may be more predictive of defaults.
